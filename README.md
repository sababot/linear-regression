# Linear Regression
Linear regression implementation in c++. It is a fairly simple implementation which focuses on keeping it simple and easy to understand. Linear regression is used to predict the relationship between two variables such as x and y. The training data is hard coded and can be changed in the code. Additionally, an updated version of the code will be pushed where you can import custom csv files to use as training data.
